%    Version number matches mnras.cls
%    A few minor tweaks to wording
% v1.0 September 2013
%    Beta testing only - never publicly released
%    First version: a simple (ish) template for creating an MNRAS paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae,aecompl}

\usepackage{graphicx}	% Including figure files
\graphicspath{ {../images/} }   % [added by JP - home, then down 1 level]


%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN PACKAGES HERE %%%%%

% Only include extra packages if you really need them. Common packages are:
\usepackage{graphicx}	% Including figure files
\usepackage{amsmath}	% Advanced maths commands
\usepackage{amssymb}	% Extra maths symbols
\usepackage{verbatim}   % added by JP for the TC word count output.

%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN COMMANDS HERE %%%%%

% Please keep new commands to a minimum, and use \newcommand not \def to avoid
% overwriting existing commands. Example:
%\newcommand{\pcm}{\,cm$^{-2}$}	% per cm-squared

% Please keep new commands to a minimum, and use \newcommand not \def to avoid
% overwriting existing commands. Example:
\newcommand{\fluxdensity}{\,W m$^{-2}$}	% watts per square meter.
\newcommand{\Mpc}{\,Mpc}	% Mega parsecs.
\newcommand{\Lsun}{\,$L_{\sun}$}	% Solar luminosity.
\newcommand{\Msun}{\,$M_{\sun}$}	% Solar mass.
\newcommand{\kms}{\,km s$^{-1}$}	% kilometres per second.
\newcommand{\ms}{\,m s$^{-1}$}	    % metres per second.

%%% JP added the following:

\newcommand*\diff{\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}} % upright d's in integrals

\newcommand{\red}[1]{{\textcolor{red}{#1}}}
\newcommand{\green}[1]{{\textcolor{green}{#1}}}
\newcommand{\blue}[1]{{\textcolor{blue}{#1}}}

\newcommand{\quickwordcount}[1]{%
  \immediate\write18{texcount -1 -sum -merge -q #1.tex > #1-words.sum }%
  \input{#1-words.sum} words%
}

\newcommand{\quickcharcount}[1]{%
  \immediate\write18{texcount -1 -sum -merge -char -q #1.tex > #1-chars.sum }%
  \input{#1-chars.sum} characters (not including spaces)%
}

% I therefore have to do some kludging to make it work without masses of blank space.
