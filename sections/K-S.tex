\section{The KS-test}
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: a statistical test to determine if two samples come from the same underlying distribution. Tests for goodness of fit. Can use \texttt{scipy.stats.kstest}, see for example \url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10884668/two-sample-kolmogorov-smirnov-test-in-python-scipy}.

Here we have run the two-sided K-S test statistic on the distribution of $\Delta$ position angles obtained from the \texttt{kinemetry} analysis. The results are given in Table \ref{tab:K-S-tests}. The statistical significance inferred from the from the K-S test is that a high value of the test statistic, together with a low p-value indicates that the samples are drawn from different statistical distributions. Here we note that the CPSB and RPSB samples originate from different distributions, and also each sample is from a different distribution from its corresponding control galaxy sample.
