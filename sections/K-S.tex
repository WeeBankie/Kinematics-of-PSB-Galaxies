\section{The KS-test}
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: a statistical test to determine if two samples come from the same underlying distribution, see e.g. \citet{hodges1958significance}. We implement this test using the \texttt{scipy.stats.kstest} module\footnote{\href{}{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ks\_2samp.html}}.

Here we have run the two-sided K-S test statistic on the distribution of $\Delta$ position angles obtained from the \texttt{kinemetry} analysis. The results are given in Table \ref{tab:K-S-tests}. The statistical significance inferred from the from the K-S test is that a high value of the test statistic, typically > 0.05, together with a low p-value, < 0.1 indicates that the samples are drawn from different statistical distributions. Here we note that the CPSB and RPSB samples originate from different distributions, and also each sample is from a different distribution from its corresponding control galaxy sample. The Python implementation \texttt{scipy.stats.ks\_2samp} accepts samples of different sizes.
