\subsection{Post-starburst (PSB) Galaxies}
\label{sec:PSBs}
Vivienne has been involved in the preparation of a number of papers researching PSBs: \citet{2017MNRAS.472.1401A} regarding the relationship between quenching of star formation and morphological transition, while \citet{2016MNRAS.463..832W} sets out the background work.
\par Galaxy evolution has been explained by many authors [TOSO] by referring to a galaxy colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMD1}. Late-type blue, often spiral galaxies in the lower-right 'blue cloud' region can transition to the redder mainly early-type elliptical galaxies along the upper left 'red sequence' region of the CMD. There is a sparsely populated region separating the two populations: this is often referred to as the 'green valley' region. In this paper we explore galaxies in transition between the blue cloud and the red sequence, through the green valley.
