\subsection{Post-starburst (PSB) Galaxies}
\label{sec:PSBs}
Vivienne has been involved in the preparation of a number of papers researching PSBs: \citet{2017MNRAS.472.1401A} regarding the relationship between quenching of star formation and morphological transition, while \citet{2016MNRAS.463..832W} sets out the background work.
\par Galaxy evolution has been explained by many authors [TODO: expand to create a list] \citep{baldry2004quantifying,2006MNRAS.373..469B} by referring to galaxy colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) \citep[see e.g.][]{2001AJ....122.1861S, 2003ApJ...585L...5H, 2003ApJS..149..289B}. Fig.~\ref{fig:CMD1} provides an example of a CMD constructed from SDSS observations of 20,000 nearby galaxies. Young blue, often spiral, galaxies in the lower-right 'blue cloud' region are understood to transition to the redder mainly early-type elliptical quiescent galaxies along the upper left 'red sequence' region of the CMD. There is a sparsely populated region separating the two populations: this is often referred to as the 'green valley' region \citep{2004ApJ...608..752B}. In this paper we explore galaxies in transition between the blue cloud and the red sequence, through the green valley.
\citet{Mutch_2011} claim that both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy M31 are in evolutionary transition due to a lack of cold gas and lie within the green valley region of the galaxy CMD.
