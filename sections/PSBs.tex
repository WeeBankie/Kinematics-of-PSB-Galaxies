\subsection{Post-starburst (PSB) Galaxies}
\label{sec:PSBs}
Vivienne has been involved in the preparation of a number of papers researching PSBs: \citet{2017MNRAS.472.1401A} regarding the relationship between quenching of star formation and morphological transition, while \citet{2016MNRAS.463..832W} sets out the background work.
\par Galaxy evolution has been explained by referring to a galaxy colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMD1}.
