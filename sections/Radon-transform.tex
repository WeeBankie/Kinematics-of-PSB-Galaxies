\section{Methods II: The Radon transform}
\label{sec:methods-II-Radon}

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Many galaxies display kinematic features in their morphology such as warps, kinematically decoupled cores (KDCs), bars, oval distortions, tidal tails etc. The global kinematic $\Delta$PA${k}$ is single number value, representing a broad average for the the entire galaxy. Fine details of the radial variation across a velocity field can be obtained using the \textbf{Radon transform} method.

In addition, PSBs have depleted their gas and star formation has shut down. The differential kinematic position angles $\Delta$PA${k}$ cannot be easily measured in gas-poor galaxies like our PSBs. However the Radon transform method can be applied to either or both the gas and stellar velocity fields. For our purposes we apply the Radon transform to the stellar velocity maps (only) of gas-poor PSBs. 


\subsection{Description of the Radon transform}

The Radon transform (RT) is a mathematical transformation of an image devised to reveal internal properties of an object such as structure. The transform method was originally devised by Johann Radon in 1917 \citep{radon1917determination}. Since then the technique has been applied to many fields, including various branches of astronomy including microwave, radio and x-ray applications. \citet{deans2007radon} describes many of these applications. The book also includes an English translation of Radon's original German text. In another work the PhD thesis of  Peter Toft \citet{7910dc8d5b654c90ac4bc94c67d06f01} promotes the application of Radon transforms in the field of digital signal processing and presents algorithms for its implementation. For our present purposes \cite{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} describe the application of the Radon transform method to galaxy kinematic studies. They developed IDL code routines to analyse the kinematic properties of stellar and gas velocity fields obtained from the MaNGA integral field survey. The objective is to quantify radial variations in the kinematic position angles (PA$_{k}$).

Line integrals across a 2-D image in x,y coordinate space are calculated along all possible lines, parameterised by the coordinates [$\theta$, $\rho$]. The left panel shows examples of two solid lines, L$_1$ and L$_2$, which are mapped through the Radon transform function to points $\theta_1$, $\rho_1$ and $\theta_2$, $\rho_2$ in [$\theta$, $\rho$] parameter space in the right-hand panel.

Mathematically the Radon Transform, $R$, is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:radon}
    R(\rho,\theta)=\int_{L}{v(x,y)\, \diff l},
\end{equation}

where $v(x,y)$ is a 2D velocity field defined in Cartesian coordinates and $\int_{L}$ is the line integral at transform sky-plane polar coordinates ($\rho,\theta$). This transform is illustrated graphically in Figure \ref{fig:RadonTransform} where lines through an image in 2D velocity space are mapped to a series of points in Radon transform [$\theta,\rho$] space by means of line integrals at various angles about the velocity space axes, and at various radial distances offset from the velocity space origin. 


\citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} apply a modification to the Radon transform, to obtain the \textit{Absolute} Radon Transform, as defined in Equation (\ref{eqn:radon}), by taking the integral of the absolute values of the velocity field difference of each point $v(x_i,y_i)$ and the mean of all values along the line segment.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:radon_absolute}
    R_A=\int{| v(x,y) - \langle v(x,y) \rangle | \, \diff l}.
\end{equation}

There is another variant to the Absolute Radon Transform described by \citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} named the \textit{bounded}, or aperture restricted, Radon transform, R\textsubscript{AB}. Briefly, R\textsubscript{AB} involves placing integration limits $(\pm{r_{ap}})$, known as the aperture, on the integral of Equation \ref{eqn:radon_absolute} in order to limit the number of spaxels across a velocity map that will be used in the integration. \citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} developed a set of IDL (Interactive Data Language) algorithms to calculate the Radon transform on an input array representing a velocity field. The Radon transform IDL code is available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/dvstark/radon-transform}. 
The graphical output of the Radon transform code as applied to a synthetic velocity field is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Radon}.

Following \citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} we demonstrate the application of the Radon transform to stellar and gas velocity field data obtained from the SDSS-IV MaNGA integral field survey for a selection of CPSB and RPSB galaxies. The Radon transform output for the stellar (left) and gas (right) velocity fields of the central PSB 8131-6101 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:RT_8131-6101}. High velocity regions are indicated in green and low velocity areas in purple. The stellar velocity Radon transform plot (left) reveals a well defined minimum track across the radial (vertical) coordinate, again shown in purple. Notably the right hand panel showing the gas velocity transform reveals few features, possibly due to a sparsity of gas in CPSB 8131-6101.
