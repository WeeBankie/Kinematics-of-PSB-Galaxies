\section{Methods II: The Radon transform}
\label{sec:methods-II-Radon}

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
The global position angles obtained from the \texttt{kinemetry} method are well defined for coherently rotating stellar or gas velocity fields. Many galaxies display signs of radial variation in their velocity fields. Such radial variations can reflect morphological features for example: warps, kinematically decoupled cores (KDCs), bars, oval distortions and tidal tails etc. In such local regions of irregular velocity distribution the global position angle, a single number value, represents a broad average value for the galaxy. The global PA does not therefore provide a detailed description of the velocity field. A finer level of detail of the variation within a stellar or gas velocity field be obtained using the \textbf{Radon transform} method.

\subsection{Description of the Radon transform}

The Radon transform (RT) is a mathematical transformation of an image devised to reveal internal properties of an object such as structure. The transform method was originally devised by Johann Radon in 1917 \citep{radon1917determination}. Since then the technique has been applied to many fields, including various branches of astronomy including microwave, radio and x-ray applications. \citet{deans2007radon} describes many of these applications, and also includes an English translation of Radon's original German text. In his PhD thesis \citet{7910dc8d5b654c90ac4bc94c67d06f01} describes the application of the RT in the field of digital signal processing and presents algorithms for its implementation. For our purposes \cite{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} describe the application of the Radon transform to galaxy kinematic studies.

Line integrals across an image are calculated along all possible lines, parameterised by the coordinates [$\theta$, $\rho$], that cross the 2D function v(x, y). Two examples are shown in the left-hand panel, where the integrals are calculated over the solid lines, L$_1$ and L$_2$, which are perpendicular to the [$\theta, \rho$] vectors and mapped to the points $\theta_1$, $\rho_1$ and $\theta_2$, $\rho_2$ in [$\theta$, $\rho$] parameter space in the right-hand panel. In the Radon transform coordinate system, $\theta$ ranges from 0 to 180 $\deg$ while $\rho$ ranges from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ such that a position below the x-axis corresponds to $\rho < 0$.

\citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} have applied the Radon transform technique to stellar and gas velocity fields obtained from the MaNGA integral field survey in order to quantify radial variations in the kinematic position angles of galaxies (PA$_k$) using the Radon transform method \citep[see e.g.][]{radon1917determination, 7910dc8d5b654c90ac4bc94c67d06f01}. 

Mathematically the Radon Transform, $R$, is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:radon}
    R(\rho,\theta)=\int_{L}{v(x,y)\, \diff l},
\end{equation}

where $v(x,y)$ is a 2D velocity field defined in Cartesian coordinates and $\int_{L}$ is the line integral at transform sky-plane polar coordinates ($\rho,\theta$). This transform is illustrated graphically in Figure \ref{fig:RadonTransform} where lines through an image in 2D velocity space are mapped to a series of points in Radon transform [$\theta,\rho$] space by means of line integrals at various angles about the velocity space axes, and at various distances offset from the velocity space origin. 


\citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} apply a modification to the Radon transform, to obtain the \textit{Absolute} Radon Transform, as defined in Equation (\ref{eqn:radon}), by taking the integral of the absolute values of the velocity field difference of each point $v(x_i,y_i)$ and the mean of all values along the line segment.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:radon_absolute}
    R_A=\int{| v(x,y) - \langle v(x,y) \rangle | \, \diff l}.
\end{equation}

There is another variant to the Absolute Radon Transform described by \citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} named the \textit{bounded}, or aperture restricted, Radon transform, R\textsubscript{AB}. Briefly, R\textsubscript{AB} involves placing integration limits $(\pm{r_{ap}})$, known as the aperture, on the integral of Equation \ref{eqn:radon_absolute} in order to limit the number of spaxels across a velocity map that will be used in the integration. \citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} developed a set of IDL (Interactive Data Language) algorithms to calculate the Radon transform on an input array representing a velocity field. The Radon transform IDL code is available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/dvstark/radon-transform}. 
The graphical output of the Radon transform code as applied to a synthetic velocity field is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Radon}.

We are concerned with the latter, the absolute aperture-restricted Radon transform of stellar and gas velocity fields in this work. Credit Stark et al. (2018).}

Following \citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} we demonstrate the application of the Radon transform to stellar and gas velocity field data obtained from the SDSS-IV MaNGA integral field survey for a selection of CPSB and RPSB galaxies. This is new method of characterising position angles and how the $\Delta$PA varies across velocity fields. 

The Radon transform output for the stellar (left) and gas (right) velocity fields of the central PSB 8131-6101 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:RT_8131-6101}. High velocity regions are indicated in green and low velocity areas in purple. The stellar velocity Radon transform plot (left) reveals a well defined minimum track across the radial coordinate, again shown in purple. Notably the right hand panel, the gas velocity transform, reveals few features, possibly due to a sparsity of gas in CPSB 8131-6101.
