[VW] Just to clarify the goal of this project is to use kinematic maps to ascertain if the post-starburst galaxies are caused by mergers (i.e. post-mergers). [JP: remove this after revision and expansion.]
%%TC:endignore

We are investigating the kinematic properties of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies in order to determine if the star-formation quenching processes are caused by major mergers causing gas inflows or outflows. Such processes may be revealed by asymmetries in the stellar and gas velocity maps.
