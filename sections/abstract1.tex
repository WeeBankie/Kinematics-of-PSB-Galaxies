% Abstract of the paper

\begin{abstract}
We are investigating the kinematic properties of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies in order to determine if the star-formation quenching processes are caused by major mergers causing gas inflows or outflows. Such processes may be revealed by asymmetries in the stellar and gas velocity maps.
