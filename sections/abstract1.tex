% Abstract of the paper

Post-starburst galaxies (PSB) can be identified from their spectra by the presence of strong Balmer series absorption lines and weak or absent emission lines. This is consistent with a population of A-type stars and older indicating that star formation ceased within the past 1 to 2 Gyr. We use data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey to study the kinematic properties of PSB galaxies in order to determine if the star-formation quenching processes are caused by major mergers triggering a burst of intense star formation and consuming much of the available gas. Major mergers may be revealed by asymmetries in the stellar and gas velocity maps. Firstly we look at differences in the kinematic position angles (k$_{PA}$) of the velocity fields for evidence of mergers. To provide a finer level of detail we employ the Radon transform technique to identify radial variation in the k$_{PA}$ of the stellar velocity fields.
