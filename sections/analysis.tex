\subsection{Property distributions}
Here we will look at the frequency distributions (histograms) comparing the characteristics of CPSBs, RPSBs an their control galaxies.

\subsection{The KS-test}
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: a statistical test to determine if two samples come from the same underlying distribution. Tests for goodness of fit. Can use \texttt{scipy.stats.kstest}, see for example \url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10884668/two-sample-kolmogorov-smirnov-test-in-python-scipy}.

\subsection{The Radon transform}
Describe the principles of the Radon transform, its history and its purpose and relevance to this research. Refer to \cite{2018MNRAS.480.2217S}.

\subsection{Smoothed velocity fields}
[This method has already been trialled. Considered as 1st year PhD level. Need to get some references XXX.]
