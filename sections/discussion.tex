\section{Discussion and conclusions}
\label{sec:discussion}

\cite{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} made a considerable effort to explore a possible link between the observed frequencies of the 5 Radon profile types and underlying morphological features determined from the Galaxy Zoo morphology classification project. Their sample comprised $\sim$2500 galaxies from the SDSS MaNGA MPL-5 data release. This sample is representative of the entire galaxy population at z$\sim$0. They found evidence of weak associations between profile type and morphological features. These correlations are certainly not exclusive, and some care must be taken to follow their argument. The most prevalent of the identified relationships can be broadly interpreted as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Type-C: Constant profile - frequently apparent in unbarred galaxies.
    \item Type-A: Asymmetric - can be associated with tidal interactions.
    \item Type-IB: Inner bends - prevalent in strongly barred galaxies.
    \item Type-OB: Outer bends - associated with kinematic warps.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Findings}
\label{findings}
Generally CPSBs show a wide range of kinematic position angle differences $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ \textgreater 30\textdegree\ with many in the range 90 \textless $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ \textless 180\textdegree. RPSBs show a smaller range in $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ with only a few over 90\textdegree. The majority of control galaxies have small kinematic position angle differences, mainly less than 25\textdegree. Significant misalignment in the gas and stellar velocity fields of CPSBs, and to a lesser extent RPSBs, is indicative of past or ongoing disturbances as could be expected from major mergers.
We note that the distribution $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ is markedly different when comparing CPSBs with CPSB controls. This trait is also present, but to a lesser extent, in the comparison of the RPSB $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ with their controls. The distribution in differential kinematic position angles is similar for both control groups. These observations are supported by the results of K-S analysis in Section \ref{sec:K-S-test} where we find the difference in $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ of PSBs compared to their control groups to be statistically significant.

We compared the Radon profile trace results obtained from stellar velocity maps employing Voronoi VOR10 binning versus single spaxel SPX binning in Section \ref{sec:binning-methods}. We obtain cleaner trace profiles with a greater number of valid data points and tighter error bars from higher S/N maps based on single spaxel SPX binning.

[TODO] Kinemetry versus Radon transform. As described in Section \ref{sec:motivation} the Radon transform provides a distinct advantage over the kinemetry method in that it provides a detailed trace of the position angle across the velocity field enabling local regions of radial variation to be identified. 

Kinematic warps in the stellar discs of early-type field galaxies can be attributed to multiple stellar components suggestive of past dry mergers \citep{2005AJ....130.2647V}, although warps can also be sustained by tidal interactions.
From this we draw the simple conclusion that Radon trace profiles displaying outer bends, Type-OB or Type-OB+IB can be considered prospective candidates past major mergers, or post-mergers. From Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC-results} we find that 10 of of 27 CPSBs (37\%) reveal Type-OB or Type-OB+IB Radon profile signatures. 
As an area for future study we should consider a similar exercise to utilise the Galaxy Zoo morphology classifications together with Radon profile features identified in this present study. 

Visual classification of Radon profile types was found to be very difficult; all our classifiers agreed on this point. In addition our classifiers arrived at varying interpretations of profile type class for most of the galaxies. Although the same written classification procedure was followed, the method was quite loosely defined, recognising the difficulties in relating the race plots to the examples. With so few classifiers involved we conclude that there is significant classification error present in our results, remembering the the Galaxy Zoo project engaged $\sim10^5$ classifiers to minimise classification error.

The results of the visual classification of the 5 Radon trace type profiles for CPSBs, RPSBs and their control groups as presented in Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC-results} and shown graphically in Figure \ref{fig:Radon-grouped-barchart} are quantitatively similar in number. This was unexpected and is presently not fully explained. We can, however, expect more galaxies with constant features in the RPSB groups than the CPSBs as RPSBs exhibit PSB features in local regions only while we can expect a higher percentage of the non-linear features, i.e. inner and outer bends and composite bend features Type-OB+IB, to be apparent in the trace profiles of CPSBs due to their central and more widespread post-starburst regions. Incorporating the the results from the second classifier a picture emerges that Type-OB features are 70\% more prevalent in both the CPSB sample to controls, and RPSBs to their controls. 

\subsection{Summary}
\label{summary}
In the past major mergers have been detected using imaging techniques. In this project we have attempted to identify past major mergers in PSB galaxies, firstly by investigating the distributions of differences in stellar and gas velocity field kinematic position angles, and secondly by using the Radon transform method to reveal radial variation in kinematic position angles. This has not proved conclusive. More work is required on the classification of kinematic features apparent in the Radon profile trace plots. However, \cite{2019DDA....5020304N} have recently announced work on a method which promises to increase the accuracy of merger detection using a method that integrates imaging and kinematic analysis techniques. This extended method will combine SDSS imaging (providing morphological observations) with MaNGA  kinematic maps, towards enhanced identification of merger and post-merger signatures. When available, this technique should be applied to our PSB and control samples to detect evidence of past mergers. With this technique we may be able to increase our likelihood estimates of positive detection of past major merger events in post-starburst galaxies.
