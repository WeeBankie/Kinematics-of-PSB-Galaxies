We have four topics to discuss here:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Velocity map binning methods:} a technical discussion on the comparative merits of alternative MaNGA velocity map binning methods and IFU sizes to obtain best resolution Radon profile traces.
\item \textbf{Correlation between Radon profiles classes and morphology:} we discuss a possible relationship between Radon transform trace profile Types and galaxy morphology.
\item \textbf{Findings and conclusions:} a review of the significant findings of the project and presentation of our conclusions.
\item \textbf{Future work:} some topics for future work noted during the course of the project.

\subsection[Correlation between Radon profiles and morphology]{Correlation between Radon profile types and morphological features}
\label{correlations}
\cite{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} made considerable efforts to explore  possible correlations between the observed frequencies of the 5 Radon profile types (Type-C, Type-A, Type-IB, Type-OB and Type-OB+IB) and underlying morphological features obtained from the Galaxy Zoo morphology classification project. They found some evidence of associations between Radon profile trace type and morphological features, as discussed in detail in their paper, Section 5. These correlations are subjective and certainly not exclusive of other possible Radon type to morphology relationships. Care must be taken to follow their arguments closely. The most prevalent of the identified relationships can be broadly interpreted as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Type-C: Constant profile - often apparent in unbarred galaxies.
\item Type-A: Asymmetric profile - can be associated with tidal interactions.
\item Type-IB: Inner bends - prevalent in strongly barred galaxies.
\item Type-OB: Outer bends - associated with kinematic warps.
\end{itemize}

Following the above interpretation there is an argument that Radon profile Type-OB outer bend features may be associated with kinematic warps, and in this way could represent the signature of past mergers. 
As reported in our results Section \ref{sec:comparison-of-results} we found that 5 out of 14 PSBs with large $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ offsets were assigned Radon profile trace classification of Type-OB. We emphasise that this result was determined by Classifier A, and there was little consensus with the classifications of either Classifier B, or in the limited number of automatic classifications that were available for our galaxies. Setting this point aside, some correlation may exist between Radon outer bend profiles, large $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ and past major mergers. Again we stress that much further work is required to provide consistent interpretations of Radon profile trace types before we can make this conclusion.

\subsection{Findings}

Generally CPSBs show a wide range of kinematic position angle differences $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ \textgreater 30\textdegree\ with many in the range 90 \textless\ $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ \textless\ 180\textdegree. RPSBs show a smaller range in $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ with only a few over 90\textdegree. The majority of control galaxies have small kinematic position angle differences, mainly less than 25\textdegree. Significant misalignment in the gas and stellar velocity fields of CPSBs, and to a lesser extent RPSBs, is indicative of past or ongoing disturbances as could be expected from major mergers.
We note that the distribution $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ is markedly different when comparing CPSBs with CPSB controls. This trait is also present, but to a lesser extent, in the comparison of the RPSB $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ with their controls. The distribution in differential kinematic position angles is similar for both control groups. These observations are supported by the results of K-S analysis in Section \ref{sec:K-S-test} where we find the difference in $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ of both PSB groups compared to their control groups to be statistically significant. \green{From this we conclude that there is evidence presented from the $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ distributions, the K-S statistical analysis performed on these $\Delta$PA$_{k}$ distributions, together with the distributions in S\'ersic index that there is a evolutionary sequence from the normal (control) galaxies, to the disc-like RPSBs and on to the redder spheroidal CPSBs. The quenching of star formation in ring-shaped features in RPSBs and the central regions of CPSBs provides compelling evidence of past major mergers, triggering morphological transformation from late-type galaxies to spheroids and an evolutionary transition from the blue cloud, through the green valley, and on towards the red sequence.}

We compared the Radon profile trace results obtained from stellar velocity maps employing Voronoi VOR10 binning versus the single spaxel SPX unbinned schema. We obtained cleaner trace profiles (i.e. easier to classify) with a greater number of valid data points and tighter error bars from high S/N maps based on single spaxel SPX binning. For future studies, given a large enough sample of PSBs, we should avoid Voronoi binned maps where possible and use SPX maps a cut of S/N \textgreater say 3-5 in single spaxels.

Kinematic PA analysis versus Radon transform: as described in Section \ref{sec:motivation} the Radon transform provides distinct advantages over the kinematic $\Delta$PA$_{k}$  method. Radon transforms provide a detailed trace of position angle across the velocity field enabling local regions of radial variation to be identified. Kinematic PAs require both stellar and gas velocity fields to be mapped but post-starburst galaxies may possess little gas. The Radon transform can trace disturbances as evidence of mergers using the stellar velocity field alone.

Kinematic warps in the stellar discs of early-type field galaxies can be attributed to multiple stellar components suggestive of past dry mergers \citep{2005AJ....130.2647V}, although warps can also be sustained by tidal interactions.
From this we draw the simple conclusion that Radon trace profiles displaying outer bends, Type-OB or Type-OB+IB can be considered prospective candidates past major mergers, or post-mergers. From Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC-results} we find that 10 of of 27 CPSBs (37\%) reveal Type-OB or Type-OB+IB Radon profile signatures. As an area for future study we should consider a similar exercise to utilise the Galaxy Zoo morphology classifications together with Radon profile feature types as identified in this present study. 

Visual classification of Radon profile types was found to be very difficult, our classifiers agreed on this point. In addition our classifiers arrived at varying interpretations of profile type class for most of the galaxies. Although the same written classification procedure was followed, the method was quite loosely defined, recognising the difficulties in relating the race plots to the examples. With so few classifiers involved we conclude that there is significant classification error present in our results, remembering the the Galaxy Zoo project engaged $\sim10^5$ classifiers to minimise classification error.

The results of the visual classification of the 5 Radon trace type profiles for CPSBs, RPSBs and their control groups as presented in Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC-results} and shown graphically in Figure \ref{fig:Radon-grouped-barchart} are quantitatively similar in number. This was unexpected and is presently not fully explained. We can, however, expect more galaxies with constant features in the RPSB groups than the CPSBs as RPSBs exhibit PSB features in local regions only while we can expect a higher percentage of the non-linear features, i.e. inner and outer bends and composite bend features Type-OB+IB, to be apparent in the trace profiles of CPSBs due to their central and more widespread post-starburst regions. 

\subsection{Summary}
\label{summary}
Previously major mergers have been detected using imaging techniques. In this project we have attempted to identify past major mergers in PSB galaxies, firstly by investigating the distributions of differences in stellar and gas velocity field kinematic position angles, and secondly by using the Radon transform method to reveal radial variation in kinematic position angles. This analysis did not prove conclusive. More work is required to provide consistent classification of kinematic features apparent in the Radon profile trace plots. It is noted however that \cite{2019DDA....5020304N} have recently announced work which promises to increase the accuracy of merger detection using a method that integrates imaging and kinematic analysis techniques. This extended method will combine SDSS imaging (providing morphological observations) with MaNGA  kinematic maps, towards enhanced identification of merger and post-merger signatures. When available, this technique should be applied to our PSB and control samples to provide additional evidence of past mergers in post-starburst galaxies.
