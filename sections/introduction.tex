\subsection{SDSS IV MaNGA}
An overview of the SDSS MaNGA project is provided by \citet{2015ApJ...798....7B}. A concise description of the \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/798/1/7/meta#apj504473s3}{survey design} is included in Section 3. \citet{2008MNRAS.388.1321P} have analysed the distribution of galaxy shapes in the SDSS DR6.
The MaNGA SDSS-IV drpall file is a FITS-format summary table of the MaNGA data analysis pipeline (DAP) as described by \citet{2019arXiv190100856W}. In this project we are using version 2.4.3 of the DAP. [JP: how about the DRP \citet{2016AJ....152...83L}?]

\subsection{Structure}
The content of the paper is organised as follows: Section \ref{sec:sample} describes the conditions required for PSB sample and the corresponding control galaxies. Data analysis methods are discussed in Section \ref{sec:analysis}. Finally, a summary of the research and the conclusions drawn from this work, along with recommendations for further study are presented in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.
