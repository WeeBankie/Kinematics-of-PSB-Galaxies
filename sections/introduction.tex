\subsection{SDSS IV MaNGA}
An overview of the SDSS MaNGA project is provided by \citet{2015ApJ...798....7B}. A concise description of the \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/798/1/7/meta#apj504473s3}{survey design} is included in Section 3. \citet{2008MNRAS.388.1321P} have analysed the distribution of galaxy shapes in the SDSS DR6. The shapes of high-redshift galaxies has been investigated by \citet{2012ApJ...754L..24C}.
