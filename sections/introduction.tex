\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%This is an example file to contain the introduction text.

\par This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide. All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field and describes the problem the authors aim to solve.

An overview of the SDSS MaNGA project is provided by \citet{Bundy_2014}. A concise description of the \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/798/1/7/meta#apj504473s3}{survey design} is included in Section 3. \citet{2008MNRAS.388.1321P} have analysed the distribution of galaxy shapes in the SDSS DR6. The shapes of high-redshift galaxies has been investigated by \citet{2012ApJ...754L..24C}.

Vivienne has written a number of articles post-starburst galaxies. This is covered in Section \ref{sec:PSB_gals}.

We have now setup synchronising with GitHub and are testing to see that this works OK.
