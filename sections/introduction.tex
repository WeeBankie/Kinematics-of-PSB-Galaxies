\subsection{Galaxy evolution}
\label{sec:evolution}

The prevalent theory of galaxy evolution is often explained  by  by referring to galaxy colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) \citep[see e.g.][]{2001AJ....122.1861S, 2003ApJ...585L...5H, 2003ApJS..149..289B,baldry2004quantifying,2006MNRAS.373..469B}. A representative CMD constructed from SDSS observations of 20,000 nearby galaxies is presented in  Figure~\ref{fig:CMD1}. Gas-rich, star-forming, often disc-like galaxies populate the so-called 'blue cloud' region of the CMD. As gas is consumed through star formation blue cloud galaxies are understood to transition to the redder mainly early-type elliptical quiescent galaxies along the upper left in the 'red sequence' region of the CMD. There is a sparsely populated region separating the blue cloud and red sequence populations often referred to as the 'green valley' region of the CMD  \citep{2004ApJ...608..752B}. In this paper we explore the evolutionary pathway of galaxies in transition between the blue cloud and the red sequence, through the green valley.
It is of interest to note \citet{Mutch_2011} claim that the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy M31 are in evolutionary transition due to consumption of cold gas and both lie within the green valley region of the galaxy CMD.

\subsection{Post starburst Galaxies}

[TODO: write a piece on PSBs and their significance in the theory of galaxy evolution.]

Post-starburst (PSB) galaxies are those galaxies where their spectra indicate that star formation has ceased within the past gigayear or so. The is no spectral evidence of young O and B-type stars which will have gone supernova in that time. PSB spectra are dominated by the strong Balmer absorption lines typical of A-type stars. Emission lines characteristic of ongoing star formation are weak or absent. The morphology of PSBs is often that of early-type ellipticals. PSBs are therefore also referred to as E+A or k+A galaxies. These observations indicate a brief burst of star formation in the past 1 to 2 Gyr which has subsequently ceased, or been 'quenched'. It has been suggested that major merger events can have produced such a period of intense star formation.

[TODO: reformulate the following paragraph]
Vivienne has been involved in the preparation of a number of papers researching PSBs: \citet{2017MNRAS.472.1401A} regarding the relationship between quenching of star formation and morphological transition, while \citet{2016MNRAS.463..832W} sets out the background work.


\subsection{SDSS IV MaNGA}
An overview of the SDSS MaNGA project is provided by \citet{2015ApJ...798....7B}. A concise description of the \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/798/1/7/meta#apj504473s3}{survey design} is included in Section 3. We use data release DR15 of the SDSS MaNGA-IV survey \citep{2019ApJS..240...23A} and the associated FITS-format galaxy data summary table output from the MaNGA data reduction pipeline (DRP) \texttt{drpall} file version 2.4.3 as described by \citet{2016AJ....152...83L}. The output of the DRP is fed to the MaNGA data analysis pipeline (DAP) which, for DR15 and the purposes of this paper provides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spatially stacked spectra
    \item Stellar kinematics (V and $\sigma$)
    \item Nebular emission-line properties: fluxes, equivalent widths, and kinematics (V and $\sigma$)
    \item Spectral Indices: absorption-line (e.g., H$\delta)$ and bandhead (e.g., D4000) measurements
\end{itemize}

The DRP data fields of interest used in this project are listed in Table \ref{tab:DRPall-table}.

\subsection{Structure of the paper}
The content of the paper is organised as follows: A concise review of the literature on galaxy mergers and morphology transitions relevant to the paper is introduced in Section \ref{sec:mergers}. The selection criteria for the PSB sample and control galaxies are laid out in Section \ref{sec:sample}. Data analysis methods and results are presented in Section \ref{sec:analysis}. The method of the velocity field analysis method employing the Radon transform method is a significant analysis tool in its own right. This is discussed in some detail in Section \ref{sec:Radon}. Finally, a summary of the research and the conclusions drawn from this work, along with recommendations for further study are presented in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.
