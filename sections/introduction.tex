%This is an example file to contain the introduction text.

\par This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide. All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field and describes the problem the authors aim to solve.

\subsection{SDSS IV MaNGA}
An overview of the SDSS MaNGA project is provided by \citet{2015ApJ...798....7B}. A concise description of the \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/798/1/7/meta#apj504473s3}{survey design} is included in Section 3. \citet{2008MNRAS.388.1321P} have analysed the distribution of galaxy shapes in the SDSS DR6. The shapes of high-redshift galaxies has been investigated by \citet{2012ApJ...754L..24C}.

\subsection{Structure}
The content of the paper is organised as follows: Section \ref{sec:sample} describes the conditions required for PSB sample and the corresponding control galaxies. Data analysis methods are discussed in Section \ref{sec:analysis}. Finally, a summary of the research and the conclusions drawn from this work, along with recommendations for further study are presented in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.
