\subsection{Mergers and morphology}

Here we present a review of the literature on the detection of mergers and post-mergers, using morphology alone.

Galaxy morphology describes the transition of smaller, generally late-type normally disc galaxies from the so-called 'blue cloud' region of a galaxy colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) to large early-type elliptical galaxies distributed along the 'red sequence' region. Classical models describe a fast-track evolutionary phase transitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence through a sparsely populated 'green valley' region of the galaxy CMD. An example of a galaxy CMD is shown in Figure \ref{fig:CMD1}.

\citet{2016MNRAS.456.3032P} describe a new morphological indicator of on-going, or past mergers, a technique they term shape asymmetry.
