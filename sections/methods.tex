\subsection{Kinemetry}





\subsection{Radon transform}

The global position angles obtained from the \texttt{kinemetry} method are well defined for coherently rotating stellar or gas velocity fields. In cases where galaxies exhibit radial variation in the velocity fields due to warps, where the velocity field in the outer regions is tilted compared with the core, in kinematically decoupled cores (KDCs), or in local regions of irregular velocity distribution the global PA does not provide a clear-cut description of the velocity field. A finer level of detail of the radial variation of the velocity field be accomplished using the Radon transform method.
