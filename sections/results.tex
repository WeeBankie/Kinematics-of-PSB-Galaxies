\label{sec:results}

\subsection{PSB property distributions}
\label{sec:property-distributions}
Here examine the frequency distributions (histograms) comparing the characteristics of CPSBs, RPSBs an their control galaxies.

The surface brightness profile of a galaxy is generally a function of radius from the nucleus. The rate of change of brightness can be described by the S\'ersic function or S\'ersic  index (SI). Low values of SI $\sim$1 relate to disc-type galaxies, whereas SI values of 3 or more are measured in galaxies with compact bright nuclei, indicative of more evolved systems. We compare the distributions of CPSBs with that of the RPSB sample in terms of S\'ersic index, stellar mass $M_*$, and redshift z. These distributions are taken from the data in Tables \ref{tab:my-CPSBs} and \ref{tab:my-RPSBs}. The frequency distribution histograms are plotted in Figures \ref{fig:Sersic-plot}, \ref{fig:stellar-mass-plot} and \ref{fig:redshift-plot} respectively.

The distribution of S\'ersic index values as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Sersic-plot} covers a wide range of values indicating a wide range of morphologies. CPSBs  generally have higher S\'ersic index values than RPBs. This suggests that CPBs tend to have concentrated nuclei and a spheroidal morphology contrary to the more disc-like RPSBs with lower SI-n values.

The velocity field position angle variance of the CPSB and PSB control galaxies is shown in Figure \ref{fig:controlDeltaPAs}. Both sets of control galaxies have low values of velocity field $\Delta$PAs, i.e. the stellar velocity and gas velocity fields are generally aligned.

\subsection{Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of position angle distributions}
\label{sec:K-S-test}
To investigate the likelihood that the $\Delta$ position angles of the CPSBS, RPSBs, and their respective control galaxy groups we employ a \textbf{Kolmogorov-Smirnov test} (K-S) analysis. K-S analysis is a statistical test to determine if two samples come from the same underlying distribution, see e.g. \citet{hodges1958significance}. We implement this test using the Python SciPy package \texttt{scipy.stats.kstest} module\footnote{\href{}{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ks\_2samp.html}}.

We ran the two-sided K-S test statistic on the distribution of $\Delta$ position angles obtained from the \texttt{kinemetry} analysis. The results are given in Table \ref{tab:K-S-tests}. The statistical significance inferred from the from the K-S test is that a high value of the test statistic, typically > 0.1, together with a low p-value, < 0.1 indicates that the samples are drawn from different statistical distributions. Here we note that the CPSB and RPSB samples originate from different distributions, and also each sample is from a different distribution from its corresponding control galaxy sample. The Python implementation \texttt{scipy.stats.ks\_2samp} accepts samples of different sizes.

\begin{table}
\caption[Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test of $\Delta$PA distributions]{A Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test on various $\Delta$PA sample distributions. A high value of the K-S statistic \textgreater 10\%, together with a low p-value, \textless 10\% indicates that the samples may originate from different statistical distributions.}
\label{tab:K-S-tests}
\begin{tabular}{llcc}
\hline
$\Delta$PA sample 1  & $\Delta$PA sample 2 & K-S statistic & p-value \\
\hline
CPSB & RPSB & 0.467 & 0.040 \\
CPSB & CPSB controls & 0.755 & 0.000 \\
RPSB & RPSB controls & 0.520 & 0.000 \\
CPSB controls & RPSB controls & 0.197 & 0.001 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Radon profile classification}
\label{sec:Radon-profile-classification}

A summary of the final visual classification method is shown in Table \ref{tab:Radon-class-summary}. The results of the Radon profile classification process for each of the individual target galaxies is provided in Appendix \ref{sec:visual-classification-tables}, Table \ref{tab:full-visual-classification}. 

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \caption[Summary of Radon profile type visual classifications]{Summary of the classification of Radon profile types as categorised visually in the CPSB and RPSB groups and their control samples. A few galaxies could not be visually classified (NC) through the analysis due to masked areas in the central spaxels of the MaNGA maps, or otherwise low signal to noise areas to enable the \texttt{radon\_wrapper} code to produce sufficient transform results.}
    \label{tab:Radon-class-summary}
    \begin{tabular}{lc}
    \hline
    Radon profile type & Number in classification \\
    \hline
    Type-A: Asymmetric & 25 \\
    Type-C: Constant & 38 \\
    Type-IB: Inner Bend & 22 \\
    Type-OB: Outer Bend & 17 \\
    Type-OB+IB: Outer and Inner Bends & 17 \\
    NC: Not classified & 8 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

On completion of the Radon profile classification we investigate the distribution of the Radon profile types in each of the PSB categories (CPSB and RPSB) and their control samples (CPSB-controls and RPSB-controls). As mentioned earlier the visual classification was performed on the merits of the Radon output plots, Radon Transform (RT) and Radon profile trace without prior knowledge of the PSB group classification. A summary of the Radon profile visual classification assessments grouped by galaxy group category is provided in Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC-results}.

\begin{table*}
\caption[Radon profile visual classification CPSB and RPSB samples and their control galaxies]{Results of the Radon profile visual classification assessments for CPSB and RPSB samples and their control galaxies. PSBs and controls were assigned a Radon profile according to the appearance of the shape of the Radon profile trace plot. Where clear features were evident the galaxy was assigned a Radon profile Type as described in the text. Galaxies that could not be objectively classified due to poor data were flagged as 'not classified' (NC). The percentage of each Type of those classified in the group shown in parentheses.}

\end{table*}

The results of the visual classification exercise laid out in Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC-results} are portrayed graphically in Figure .   

The Radon profile classification results summarised in Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC-results} reveal that galaxies with bend features, Type-IB, Type-OB and Type-IB+OB, are clearly more prevalent in CPSBs (16 out of 27, or 59\% of galaxies classified) than in RPSBs (15 out of 36, or 42\% of those classified). A similar trend is found in the control groups: CPSB controls exhibit 18 out of 29, or 62\% with bend features, while RPSB controls have 11 out of 31, or 35\% with bend features. These results are portrayed graphically in Figure \ref{fig:Radon-grouped-barchart}.

\end{table}

It is noted the majority of PSBs with $\Delta$PA offsets \textgreater 30\textdegree\ listed in Tables \ref{tab:offsetCPSBs-Radon-Type} and \ref{tab:offsetRPSBs-Radon-Type} show constant or asymmetric radial Radon profiles, however a few outer and inner bend profiles are evident. 

\subsection{Independent visual classification}
\label{independent-classification}
A second Radon profile classification exercise was carried out by an independent classified, but following the same procedure described earlier. The results of this supplementary classification are summarised in Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC2-results}.

\begin{table*}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Comparing the Radon profile visual classification results in Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC-results} and Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC2-results} we note an apparent skew in the classifications of Type-C, constant, and Type-A, asymmetric profiles. This may be due to the similarity of the examples given in Figure 5 of \cite{2018MNRAS.480.2217S}. Both the example profiles display some measure of asymmetry and also show a relatively constant profile in their central regions, around $\rho=0$. In fact there is some indication of inner bend features in both the Type-C and Type-A examples. So visual classification is difficult, and this conclusion was noted by both classifiers. We continue further discussion on this point in Section \ref{sec:discussion}. Setting aside the difficulties of Type-A and Type-C classifications, we note that similar numbers galaxies with with bend-type features, Type-OB, Type-IB and Type-OB+IB were identified by both classifiers. We emphasise, however, that there was still considerable variation in classification for specific individual galaxies. The results of the two independent classifications for the 3 bend-feature categories, in each of the 4 galaxy groups, is summarised in Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC3-results}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Table \ref{tab:Radon-VC3-results} provides a summary of the Radon profile type classification results of two classifiers working independently, and without prior knowledge of the four galaxy groupings. We sum the results obtained by classifier A and B into a third column: 'Summed consensus' at the right-hand side. Here we note that the Type-IB and Type-IB+OB summary numbers are very similar, or nearly the same for all galaxy group. We note a significant exception to this uniformity evident in the summed consensus for Type-OB features. The ratio of outer bend, Type-OB, features in CPSBs is 10 to 7 or 43\% more prevalent compared to their controls. , while in the RPSB groups the Type-OB features predominate in RPSBs at the ratio of 12 to 7 or 71\% more than their controls. We acknowledge that the sample size of PSBs is small and this may have influenced these results. There is a larger control galaxy sample available at 10 times the number of the CPSBs and RPSB galaxies used in this study. A larger sample of Radon profile classification of all control galaxies (some 680) would help to refine the statistical significance of these results. We will return to discuss the potential significance of the imbalance of Type-OB features in  the PSB/controls analysis in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
