\section{PSB Sample}
\label{sec:sample}

\subsection{Sample collection}
Include a write-up here on the conditions for identifying a post-starburst galaxy or region. Here is a starter for ten. Check this carefully with Chen et al. (2019) for consistency.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item H$\delta$ absorption line features
    \item Strong 4000 \AA\, break 
    \item absence of H$\alpha$ emission lines
    \item at least 6 contiguous spaxels
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Control galaxies}
Control galaxies as 'normal' galaxies not exhibiting PSB features. Also check this with Chen et al. (2019) for consistency.

\subsection{Quality screening}
We will need a short write-up from Chris on the quality flag screening of the MPL-8 data release.
