\section{Topics}
Here is a list of ideas and topics to explore:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Classification of PSBs: Post-starburst galaxies can be identified via the presence of prominent Hydrogen Balmer absorption lines in their spectra. 
    \item Diverse evolutionary channels of PSBs: see \citet{2019NatAs...3..440P}.
    \item \citet{2016ApJS..224...38A} : Shocked POststarbust Galaxy Survey. I. Candidate Post-starbust Galaxies with Emission Line Ratios Consistent with Shocks : There are many mechanisms by which galaxies can transform from blue, star-forming spirals, to red, quiescent early-type galaxies, but our current census of them does not form a complete picture. Recent observations of nearby case studies have identified a population of galaxies that quench “quietly.”
